The proper key for password it have to containing some of kind character like alphabetical, numerical, and special character. In expert proper key is combine from those kind of character. So, how the password checked work? 

On this occasion, let me explain my code about 'How's Password Checked Work' on Python code. And hopefully could educated for all.

## Result from code

From the picture above, we could see that simple password used alphabetical too weak for password ID, so the output from the code will inform you that the password is too weak, and get instruction for tried input password which more strong combine.

And the second trial, I try to input Uppercase into the password input, and get more good output 'WEAK' which means move up one level, but still get instruction for tried input more strong combined password.

At the last trial, I tried to combined all of kind character. And get perfect output.
